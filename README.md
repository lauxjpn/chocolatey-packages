## Description

If you have any issues with one of the packages hosted in this repository, please feel free to open an issue (preferred instead of using `Contact Maintainers` on chocolatey.org).

This repository contains Chocolatey packages, most of which are [automatically](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/automatic-packages) updated.

**All packages in this repository should conform with the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).** Contributions that follow the guideliness are welcome.
All packages in this repository are expected to be installable with any version of Chocolatey being made available in the past 12 months, unless a dependency on Chocolatey has been added.

## Etiquette Regarding Communication

When requesting support, try to remember that I am a volunteers that have a live outside of open source and I am not paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of my time when you are asking for things. I have a family that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. A little consideration and patience can go a long way. Thanks for understanding.

## The Repository layout

This contains Chocolatey packages, both manually and automatically maintained.

### Folder Structure

* automatic - where automatic packages are kept. These are packages that are automatically maintained using [Chocolatey-AU](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-au).
* deprecated - where deprecated packages are kept. These are packages that are no longer maintained.
* extensions - where extensions packages are kept. These are created by me and are manually pushed.
* icons - Where you keep icon files for the packages. This is done to reduce issues when packages themselves move around.
* manual - where packages that are not automatic are kept.
