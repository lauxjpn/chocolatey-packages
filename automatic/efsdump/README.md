Windows 2000 introduces the Encrypting File System (EFS) so that users can protect their sensitive data. Several new APIs make their debut to support this facility, including one-QueryUsersOnEncryptedFile-that lets you see who has access to encrypted files. This applet uses the API to show you what accounts are authorized to access encrypted files.

#### Command line usage

__-s__    Recurse subdirectories.

_EFSDump_ takes wildcards e.g. 'efsdump *.txt'.
